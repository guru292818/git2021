sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y

The above command will update apt and then run the full upgrade. Once this completes, reboot the system and log back in.

How to upgrade to kernel 6.0
The first method we’ll use is manually downloading the necessary files and installing them with dpkg. Here are the files you’ll want to download and the commands to do so:

wget https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/linux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-060000-generic_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_amd64.deb

wget https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/linux-modules-6.0.0-060000-generic_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_amd64.deb

wget https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/linux-headers-6.0.0-060000_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_all.deb

Now, to install those files, issue the command:

sudo dpkg -i linux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-060000-generic_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i linux-modules-6.0.0-060000-generic_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-6.0.0-060000_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_all.deb

sudo update-grub


If you get an error that the system is unable to build the modules. If that’s the case, resolve it with:

sudo apt-get install gcc make perl -y

Once the installation completes, reboot the machine and verify the kernel with:

uname -r

You should see that the system is now running kernel 6.0.

The second method uses a third-party PPA, which means that the kernel will be updated with the built-in package manager instead of having to upgrade manually as you did above.

To add the new repository, issue the command:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cappelikan/ppa

Next, update apt with:

sudo apt update

Finally, install the kernel with the command:

sudo apt install mainline 6.0.0 -y

sudo update-grub
